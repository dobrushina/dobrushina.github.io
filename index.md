I am an HCPC-registered counselling psychologist and an ISST-accredited schema therapist offering psychotherapy to adults, adolescents, children, and families. With both medical and psychological education, over ten years of experience in neurology, and a strong track record in neuroscience, I am especially helpful in supporting clients whose brains work differently—neurodivergent people, and those experiencing complex trauma or consequences of brain injury.

As a third-wave CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) therapist, I mainly use schema therapy—a contemporary approach that integrates cognitive work (addressing thoughts and beliefs) with deep emotional healing. I also blend EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), classical CBT techniques, as well as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) skills. My work is guided by the clients' real-life goals, but to achieve these goals, we often address not only present experiences but also past ones, especially if the past was traumatic.

In schema therapy, we explore schemas, which are patterns of memories, beliefs, emotions, and bodily sensations originating from childhood adversities and shaping the way we perceive and feel today. Using special techniques, we reduce the influence of schemas and develop the 'Healthy Adult'—our wiser part responsible for self-care and value-directed life. The process of schema therapy is intense and engaging. We not only talk but also move from chair to chair and work in imagination. Sometimes, we draw diagrams, because schema therapy is guided by a case conceptualization that is shared with the client. We often do role-play and skills training. I explain all the steps and the science behind them.

When working with neurodivergent clients, I consult on specific topics such as sensory needs, arousal regulation, attention difficulties, masking, and burnout (neurocoaching). I use schema therapy and EMDR to process the usually present trauma and to help my clients develop flexible, more authentic ways of dealing with current social demands. Being trained both in couple and in child and adolescent therapy, I offer support in family relationships, taking into account the influence of neurodivergence.

### When I can help
- Neurodivergence: autism, ADHD, consequences of traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain tumors
- Posttraumatic conditions, such as PTSD and cPTSD
- Anxiety and depression, other difficulties in emotional regulation
- Psychosomatic symptoms and coping with chronic diseases
- Difficulties in relationships, including couples and parenting
- Personality disorders including BPD (borderline personality disorder). Self-mutilating behaviour
- Eating disorders


### About me
I am a UK-based counselling psychologist registered with the HCPC (PYL044166) and an ISST-certified schema therapist (60360358).

My first education is medical (Lomonosov Moscow State University), and I am licensed as a medical doctor in Israel and Russia. Currently, I do not run a medical practice or prescribe medications, but I use my knowledge and experience to offer my clients the best possible psychological care. Being trained in neurology, I worked for more than ten years with neurodivergent people (autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, consequences of traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain tumours) and with psychosomatic syndromes. Due to my interest in neuropsychology and psychotherapy, I gradually shifted from classical medical work to a more integrative approach.

I completed a Master's programme in counselling psychology, studied cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) at the Beck Institute, and completed individual, couples, and child and adolescent schema therapy courses certified by the International Society of Schema Therapy (ISST). I am also trained in EMDR, acceptance and commitment therapy, co-experiencing psychotherapy, and mentalisation-based treatment. I have rich experience of my own therapy and receive regular supervision. Besides psychotherapy, I have mastered the skills of cognitive assessment and cognitive training.

With a PhD degree in Medicine, I combine psychological counselling with neuroscience [research](Research.md) and neurotechnology development. Currently, I am based at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow), in the Laboratory for Innovation in Autism. Using advanced neurophysiological methods such as fMRI, I study the brain networks regulating our emotional and physical states and develop technologies supporting mental well-being. On the practical side of neurotechnology, for many years I have been using biofeedback, neurofeedback, and QEEG to enrich my clinical work. Understanding how the nervous system functions helps me support people whose brains work differently. I adhere to the neuroaffirmative approach, not considering autistic or ADHD brain to be inferior to a neurotypical one, but recognising that it requires special care to thrive.

My professional experience includes training and supervising other professionals. I founded and led an integrative medical and psychological department for adults and children with brain injury, autism, ADHD, and other types of neurodivergence (25 professionals), co-organised a practicum on neuropsychological rehabilitation for MSc in psychology students, provided annual schools on using neurotechnologies in mental healthcare. Recently, I developed and ran a 3-day workshop, "From Neuroscience to Schema Therapy: Working with Neurodivergent Clients and More," which was attended by more than 80 participants.

I am 39 years old, married, and I have three children. I was born in Moscow, spent some of my childhood in the US, moved to Israel in 2022, and to the United Kingdom in 2024. Currently, I am happy to live and work in Scotland. My multicultural experience helps me to understand people with diverse backgrounds and those experiencing immigration.
