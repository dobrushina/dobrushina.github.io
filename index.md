I am a psychotherapist working with adults who want to enhance their emotional regulation and interpersonal efficacy and also with couples willing to improve the relationship. My favorite method is schema therapy, which is a contemporary CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) approach integrating work with cognitions (thoughts and beliefs) and deep emotional healing. My work is directed by real-life goals of the clients, but to achieve these goals we target not only present, but also past experiences, especially when the past was traumatic. We uncover the schemas&nbsp;— patterns of memories, beliefs, emotions, bodily feelings originating from childhood adversities and shaping the way we perceive and feel today. We use special techniques to ameliorate the influence of schemas and to develop the Healthy Adult&nbsp;— our wiser part responsible for the self-care and value-directed life.

The process of schema therapy is intense and interesting. We not only talk, but move from chair to chair and do a lot of work in the imagination. Sometimes we draw diagrams, because schema therapy is guided by a case conceptualization that is shared with the client. I am explaining all the steps and the science underlying them.  Usually we meet once a week for an hour, and the duration of therapy varies from 20 to more than 40 sessions. There is also homework that promotes transfer of the gains into daily life.


### About me
I was born in Moscow, Russia and recently moved to Israel due to my disagreement with the actions of the Russian government. I am 37 years old, I am married and I have three children.

My basic education is medical (M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University), although currently I am not working as a doctor. I have a Ph.D. degree and I am combining psychotherapy with research in the field of neuroscience of emotion and embodiment. I am using advanced MRI methods to study the brain networks regulating our emotional and physical states and to develop technologies supporting mental well-being.

I completed a Master's program in psychological consulting in the Moscow State Psychological and Pedagogical Institute. I studied cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the Beck Institute and completed individual and couple schema therapy courses certified by the International Association of Schema Therapy (ISST). I am a member of ISST and I am working under regular supervision.
