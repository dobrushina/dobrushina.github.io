I am a counselling psychologist working with adults and adolescents on emotional regulation, interpersonal skills, and professional effectiveness. I also support couples and parents in improving family relationships. My special interests are working with neurodivergent clients and people experiencing post trauma.

Being a third-wave CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) therapist, I mainly use schema therapy—a contemporary approach that integrates cognitive work (addressing thoughts and beliefs) with deep emotional healing. I also blend into my work EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), classical CBT techniques, as well as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) skills. My work is guided by the clients' real-life goals, but to achieve these goals, we often address not only present experiences but also past ones, especially if the past was traumatic.

We explore schemas, which are patterns of memories, beliefs, emotions, and bodily sensations originating from childhood adversities and shaping the way we perceive and feel today. Using special techniques, we reduce the influence of schemas and develop the 'Healthy Adult'—our wiser part responsible for self-care and value-directed life.

The process of schema therapy is intense and engaging. We not only talk but also move from chair to chair and work in imagination. Sometimes, we draw diagrams, because schema therapy is guided by a case conceptualization that is shared with the client. We often do role-play and skills training. I explain all the steps and the science behind them. Typically, we meet once a week for an hour, and the duration of therapy can vary from 20 to over 40 sessions. There is also homework that promotes the transfer of gains into daily life.

When working with neurodivergent clients, I consult on specific topics such as sensory needs, arousal regulation, strategies to compensate for attention difficulties, masking, and burnout (neurocoaching). I use schema therapy and EMDR to process trauma related to growing up in a world designed for neurotypicals and to help my clients develop flexible, more authentic ways of dealing with current social demands.


### When I can help
- Neurodivergence: autism, ADHD, consequences of traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain tumors
- Posttraumatic conditions, such as PTSD and cPTSD
- Anxiety and depression, other difficulties in emotional regulation
- Psychosomatic symptoms and coping with chronic diseases
- Difficulties in relationships, including couples and parenting
- Personality disorders including BPD (borderline personality disorder). Self-mutilating behaviour
- Eating disorders


### About me
I am a UK-based counselling psychologist registered with the HCPC (registration number PYL044166) and an ISST-certified schema therapist (membership number 60360358).

My basic education is medical (M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University), and I am licensed as a medical doctor in Russia and Israel. Currently, I do not run a medical practice or prescribe medications, but I use my knowledge and experience to offer my clients the best possible psychological care. Being trained in neurology, I worked for more than ten years with neurodivergent people (autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, consequences of traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain tumors) and with psychosomatic syndromes. Due to my interest in neuropsychology and psychotherapy, I gradually shifted from classical medical work to a more integrative approach. I completed a Master's program in psychological counselling, studied cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) at the Beck Institute, and completed individual, couples, and child and adolescent schema therapy courses certified by the International Society of Schema Therapy (ISST). I am also trained in EMDR, acceptance and commitment therapy, co-experiencing psychotherapy, and mentalization-based treatment. I have a rich experience of my own therapy. Besides psychotherapy, I have mastered the skills of cognitive assessment and cognitive training.

With a PhD in Medicine, I combine psychological counselling with neuroscience research and neurotechnology development. Currently, I am based at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow), in the Laboratory for Innovation in Autism. Using advanced neurophysiological methods such as fMRI, I study the brain networks regulating our emotional and physical states and develop technologies supporting mental well-being. On the practical side of neurotechnology, for many years I have been using biofeedback, neurofeedback, and QEEG in clinical practice.Understanding how the nervous system functions helps me support people whose brains work differently. I adhere to the neuroaffirmative approach, not considering autistic or ADHD brain to be inferior to the neurotypical one, but recognizing that it requires special care to realize its potential.

My professional experience includes training and supervising other professionals. In Russia, I founded and led a department providing integrative medical and psychological care to adults and children with mental difficulties related to brain injury, autism, ADHD, and other types of neurodivergence (25 professionals). I co-organised a practicum for MSc students from the Faculty of Psychology of MSU on neuropsychological rehabilitation. From 2016 to 2021, I provided annual schools titled “From Neuroscience to Neurotherapy” focused on using neurotechnologies in mental healthcare. Recently, I developed and run a 3-day workshop, "From Neuroscience to Schema Therapy: Working with Neurodivergent Clients and More," which was attended by more than 80 participants.

I am 39 years old, married, and I have three children aged 10, 6, and 2 years. I was born in Moscow, moved to Israel in 2022, and to the United Kingdom in 2024. I currently live in a quiet and beautiful place in Scotland.
