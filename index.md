I am a psychotherapist working with adults on emotional regulation, interpersonal and professional efficacy. I am also working with couples willing to improve the relationship. My favorite method is called schema therapy&nbsp;— it is a contemporary CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) approach integrating work with cognitions (thoughts and beliefs) and deep emotional healing. I am also using classical CBT approaches targeting dysfunctional cognitions, approaches from ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) and DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). My work is directed by real-life goals of the clients, but to achieve these goals we usually target not only present, but also past experiences, especially when the past was traumatic. We uncover the schemas&nbsp;— patterns of memories, beliefs, emotions, bodily feelings originating from childhood adversities and shaping the way we perceive and feel today. We use special techniques to ameliorate the influence of schemas and to develop the Healthy Adult&nbsp;— our wiser part responsible for the self-care and value-directed life.

The process of schema therapy is intense and interesting. We not only talk, but move from chair to chair and do a lot of work in the imagination. Sometimes we draw diagrams, because schema therapy is guided by a case conceptualization that is shared with the client. Often we do roleplay and skills training. I am explaining all the steps and the science underlying them.  Usually we meet once a week for an hour, and the duration of therapy varies from 20 to more than 40 sessions. There is also homework that promotes transfer of the gains into daily life.

### About me
I was born in Moscow, Russia and recently moved to Israel due to my disagreement with the actions of the Russian government. I am 37 years old, married and I have three children.

My basic education is medical (M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University), although currently I am not working as a doctor. Being trained in neurology, for 10 years I worked with neurodiverse people (consequences of traumatic brain injury and stroke, neurooncology, mild cognitive impairment, ASD, ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders) and also with psychosomatic syndromes. I have a Ph.D. degree and I am combining psychotherapy with research in the field of neuroscience of emotion and embodiment. I am using advanced MRI methods to study the brain networks regulating our emotional and physical states and to develop technologies supporting mental well-being.

I completed a Master's program in psychological consulting in the Moscow State Psychological and Pedagogical Institute. I studied cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the Beck Institute and completed individual and couple schema therapy courses certified by the International Association of Schema Therapy (ISST). I am a member of ISST and I am working under regular supervision.
